This project is a clone of the official **Yves Saint Laurent (YSL)** website. The goal of this project is to showcase my ability to replicate the design and functionality of
a high-end e-commerce platform. It focuses on creating
a visually accurate and functional static website as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my web development skills.

## **Features**
- Pixel-perfect design closely resembling the YSL website.
- Built with clean and maintainable HTML and CSS.
- Functional navigation and interactive UI components.
- Static content, optimized for visual demonstration.

---

## **Current Limitations**
- **Non-responsive design**: The project is optimized for desktop screens only and does not currently support mobile or tablet viewports.
- No dynamic features or backend functionality (e.g., no shopping cart or database integration).

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
